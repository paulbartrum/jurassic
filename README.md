## What is Jurassic?

Jurassic is an implementation of the ECMAScript language and runtime. It aims to provide
the best performing and most standards-compliant implementation of JavaScript for .NET.
Jurassic is not intended for end-users; instead it is intended to be integrated into .NET
programs. If you are the author of a .NET program, you can use Jurassic to compile and
execute JavaScript code.

## Features
* Supports all ECMAScript 3 and ECMAScript 5 functionality, including ES5 strict mode
* Well tested - passes over five thousand unit tests (with over thirty thousand asserts)
* Simple yet powerful API
* Compiles JavaScript into .NET bytecode (CIL); not an interpreter
* Deployed as a single .NET assembly (no native code)
* Basic support for integrated debugging within Visual Studio
* Uses light-weight code generation, so generated code is fully garbage collected
* Tested on .NET 3.5, .NET 4 and Silverlight
